  def caveats
    <<~EOS
    On Ubuntu, you need to run
      sudo apt install -y libvlc-dev xdg-utils
    On Fedora, you need to run
      sudo dnf in -y vlc-devel xdg-utils
    Additionally, SnapX hasn't been able to create the configuration file(s) it expects.
    You should place it in the configuration directory that it expects.
    On Linux, it's
      ~/.config/SnapX
    On macOS, it's
      ~/Library/Application Support/SnapX
